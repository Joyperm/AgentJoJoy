# AI Workflow Rules — Personal

How the user works with Claude / Cursor / other AI agents on this
project. These rules sit beside team/project rules and cover how AI is
allowed to act on the owner's machine.

## Approach

Spec-first within the project's existing structure. The project's
team rules (typically in `CLAUDE.md` at repo root and `.cursor/rules/`)
define what is allowed and how code/docs should look.

When rules appear to conflict:

- Team/project repo rules win for repo content and conventions:
  code standards, architecture, review requirements, documentation
  policy, branch policy, and release process.
- AgentJoJoy safety gates win for actions taken by AI on the owner's
  machine: approvals, destructive commands, remote writes, secrets,
  production access, force operations, and personal context boundaries.

Follow the stricter rule and ask the owner when the boundary is unclear.

## AI Permission Boundaries — Ask Before You Execute

The AI may **suggest** any operation, but must **never execute** state-
or remote-changing commands without my explicit, per-action approval.
A previous approval does not carry over to a new operation, even if
similar. Each time, ask first, show the exact command, then wait for
me to say go.

### Requires my approval before execution

Git (local state):
- `git commit` (any form, including `--amend`)
- `git checkout` / `git switch` to a different branch
- `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`
- `git reset`, `git revert`
- `git branch -d` / `-D` (delete)
- `git stash pop` / `apply` / `drop` (anything that moves state)
- `git worktree add` / `remove`
- `git update-index --skip-worktree` and similar index manipulation

Git (remote):
- `git push` to any branch (including new branches)
- `git pull` (fetch is fine; merging into local is not)
- Anything talking to a remote that writes (push, push --force, etc.)

GitHub / PR:
- `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, `gh pr close`, `gh pr ready`
- `gh issue create`, `gh issue close`
- Any operation that posts a comment, opens a PR, or moves state on a
  remote service

Filesystem (destructive):
- Deleting files or folders the AI did not just create in this session
- Overwriting team-owned files (see `Protected Files / Folders` below)

Package and build:
- Installing or upgrading dependencies (`npm install <pkg>`,
  `npm upgrade`, `pip install`, `poetry add`, etc.)
- Modifying lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`,
  `Cargo.lock`, etc.)
- Running migrations or DB schema changes

Runtime / environment actions:
- Starting development servers, workers, schedulers, emulators,
  containers, browsers, desktop/mobile apps, terminals, or other
  long-running runtimes
- Running scripts with unclear side effects
- Running e2e suites that open browsers, call external services, or
  use non-local environments
- Deploying, applying infrastructure, seeding data, sending
  notifications, charging money, placing orders, trading, controlling
  hardware/devices, or touching production-like accounts/sessions
- Compiling/running/attaching to runtime-hosted projects when the
  project docs do not explicitly mark the action as a safe local
  verification command

### Safe to do without asking

- Read any file in the working tree
- `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git branch --list`,
  `git worktree list`, `git ls-files`, `git check-ignore`
- `git fetch` (read-only — updates remote-tracking refs only)
- Run documented local tests, type checks, and builds when they are
  clearly local/read-only for this project
- Read-only DB queries against a non-prod DB, if I've previously
  authorized DB access
- Inspect process / network state (`netstat`, `tasklist`, etc.)

### Command fallback after environment/runtime failure

If a command fails because of the local shell, executable wrapper, or
runtime environment, do not silently switch to a different invocation.
Report the failure, propose the fallback command, and wait for the owner's
approval before running it.

Examples:

- PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`; propose `npm.cmd run <script>` before
  retrying.
- `python` is not on PATH; propose `py`, `python3`, or the project
  venv path before retrying.
- A command works only in another shell; propose the exact shell and
  command before retrying.

This applies even when the fallback is intended to be equivalent and
read-only. The original command failed; the fallback is a new command
choice.

### Strategic choices require explicit selection (SPEC-3.5)

Separate from execution permission. **Even when a command is
allowlisted** in `settings.local.json` (so the AI may run it without
prompting), the **choice of which command to run** among multiple
valid options is reserved for me.

Examples — the AI must ask every time, regardless of session history:

- Sync strategy: rebase vs merge (vs reset, vs cherry-pick)
- Uncommitted state: commit vs stash vs discard
- Conflict resolution: which side wins, or how to combine
- Branch base: from `main`, `develop`, or another
- Cleanup timing: now vs deferred
- Force push: whether at all, with-lease vs raw `--force`
- File deletion when multiple candidates exist

For each, the AI must:
1. List the options
2. Briefly explain trade-offs
3. Wait for me to name the choice (a generic "go" / "sure" (Thai: "ได้เลย") is
   insufficient — I must pick by name)
4. Only then propose the resulting command (under SPEC-3.1)

Full definition: [workflow-spec.md](workflow-spec.md) → SPEC-3.5.

Force push is never the default path. Raw `git push --force` is
forbidden. If force is explicitly chosen after alternatives are
explained, use `--force-with-lease` only and never on
protected/default/shared branches without another explicit exception.

This rule can be relaxed later by writing a new rule that loosens it
for a specific class of choices. Until then, default = ask every
time.

### Why this rule exists

I want to keep a clear mental model of git and remote state. AI
suggestions are valuable; AI execution of irreversible operations is
not, until I've verified what's about to happen. This rule applies in
every session — re-confirm each time. If I've granted blanket
permission for a specific scope of work, that scope ends when the
current task completes.

## Environment Isolation — Worktree-Based

I do not develop directly in the main team checkout. Instead:

1. Main checkout (`<workspace-root>/<repo-folder>/`) is kept on the
   branch I have under review. Idle, untouched.
2. New work happens in a git worktree under
   `<workspace-root>/worktree-<task>/` with its own branch off
   `origin/main` (or whichever base branch the team is using).
3. Each worktree gets its own dependencies (`node_modules`, `venv`,
   etc.) and environment file copy (`.env`).
4. Any tracked-but-should-be-ignored files (e.g. a local settings
   file that leaked into the repo) are neutralized per worktree with
   `git update-index --skip-worktree`.

Full mechanics: see `workflow-notes.md`.

## Scoping Rules

- One feature unit (or one bug) per branch / per worktree.
- Prefer small, verifiable increments. If a change cannot be verified
  end to end in one sitting, it is too broad — split it.
- Do not combine unrelated system boundaries in a single
  implementation step (e.g. don't mix a UI tweak with a backend
  refactor in the same branch).

## Scope Discipline

Two failure modes to guard against during work:

1. **Human scope creep** — "just one more thing" accumulates while
   the AI executes quickly. Each addition feels small at 30 seconds;
   the aggregate quietly redefines the task.
2. **AI scope creep** — the AI extends beyond what was asked: adds
   error handling, refactors adjacent code, introduces validation, or
   "improves" things without being asked.

### Rules

**The AI must not expand scope unprompted.** Stay in the lane that
was given (the lane is the task as restated under SPEC-2.1). Do not
refactor adjacent code, add new error handling, introduce validation,
or make nice-to-have improvements unless explicitly asked.

**The AI must flag scope drift when it detects it.** Track stated goal
vs actual execution. Surface when:

- Implementation grows beyond the original request
- Multiple small adjacent changes accumulate into a larger task
- Nice-to-haves start being treated as must-haves
- The AI itself notices it is about to expand beyond the brief

When drift is detected, the AI pauses and asks: "We're moving outside
the original ask of `<X>`. Continue with the expansion, defer it, or
stop here?"

**Safety carve-out.** Emergent high-severity issues encountered while
working in scope — security vulnerabilities, credentials exposure,
data-loss risks, broken authentication, accidental destructive
commands queued in scripts — must be surfaced immediately even if
off-scope. The AI raises the finding with one short line, waits for
user direction, and does not silently fix.

### When the rule applies

"Execution" begins when the AI starts editing files or running
state-changing commands per SPEC-3.1. Before that — intake,
planning, discovery, or the `grill-me` skill — scope expansion is
the goal of the activity, not a violation. The rule kicks in at the
moment of the first file edit or state-changing command.

### Mode-aware behavior

- **`execute` mode** — Scope Discipline is **strict**. AI stays in
  lane. Detected drift triggers an explicit pause before any
  expansion.
- **`teach` mode** — AI may **mention** adjacent improvements as
  off-scope suggestions (flagged `*(off-scope suggestion)*` per
  Resolved Decision 2026-05-26), but must not **execute** them
  unprompted.
- **Intake, planning, or the `grill-me` skill** — scope expansion of
  *thinking* is the goal; this rule does not apply to brainstorming
  or design exploration. It applies once execution begins.

### Why this rule exists

The cost of "just one more thing" used to be paid in human typing
time, which created natural friction. With AI, that friction is gone
— a 30-second action costs the same as a 5-minute one. Without an
explicit scope discipline rule, both the user and the AI drift into
larger changes than they signed up for, making review harder and
increasing the chance that something unrelated to the original goal
breaks.

## When to Split Work

Split an implementation if it combines any of:

- Frontend changes with backend changes that are not tightly coupled
  to the same feature
- Multiple unrelated modules / domains
- Schema migration + new business logic + new UI all at once
- Behavior that is not clearly defined in the team's rules or in a
  reviewed spec / ticket

## Handling Missing Requirements

- Don't invent product behavior the team hasn't specified.
- If a requirement is ambiguous and there is no team doc covering it,
  flag it in `<workspace-root>/progress-tracker.md` under "Open
  Questions" and ask the lead/owner before proceeding.
- Don't infer schema, status enums, or status transitions — read the
  actual entity files and existing usages in the codebase.

## Protected Files / Folders

Project-specific protected paths live in `workflow-notes.md` (filled
in during intake). General categories to treat as protected by
default:

- **Team rule files** (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*`, `CLAUDE.md` at repo
  root) — team-owned
- **Team planning files** (e.g. `.cursor/plans/*`) — team-owned
- **Per-developer settings that leak** (e.g.
  `.claude/settings.local.json` when tracked despite `.gitignore`) —
  use `skip-worktree` instead of editing
- **Vendored / generated UI libraries** (e.g. `components/ui/`
  shadcn primitives) — treat as a library, don't re-implement
- **Schema definitions** (e.g. `shared/schema.ts`, ORM model files) —
  changes need lead review; never edit speculatively
- **Build config** (e.g. `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `webpack.config.js`) — touch only when the task explicitly requires it

Do not modify any of the above without explicit instruction.

## AI-NO-OVERWRITE Block Protection

Any block of text wrapped inside these specific HTML comment tags in any file in the workspace:

<!-- AGENTJOJOY:AI-NO-OVERWRITE BEGIN -->
...
<!-- AGENTJOJOY:AI-NO-OVERWRITE END -->

is protected from autonomous AI modification.

Rules:
- The AI must **never autonomously edit, delete, overwrite, or modify** any text or settings between these tags — not during refactoring, template upgrades, intake, or any self-initiated action.
- The AI must **preserve the tags themselves** and everything in between exactly as-is unless the user explicitly asks for a change.
- If the AI believes a change is needed inside a protected block, it must **describe the proposed change and wait for explicit user approval** before editing (per SPEC-3.5).
- When the user explicitly requests a modification to protected content, the AI **may** make the change. The protection guards against autonomous AI action, not against user-directed edits.
- This rule applies to both active session file edits and automated template upgrades.

## Keeping Personal Docs in Sync

Update files when the underlying reality changes:

- **`<workspace-root>/progress-tracker.md`** (work tracker, at root)
  — after every meaningful work action (branch created, PR pushed,
  merge done, blocker found)
- **`AgentJoJoy/agent-context/progress-tracker-setup.md`** (setup tracker) — when
  workspace structure changes or spec is amended
- **`AgentJoJoy/agent-context/architecture.md`** — if I learn something new about
  the stack or invariants
- **`AgentJoJoy/agent-context/standards.md`** — if team rules change
- **`AgentJoJoy/agent-rules/workflow-notes.md`** — if my workflow evolves (new
  gotchas, new tooling)
- **`AgentJoJoy/agent-decisions/`** — log significant decisions as their
  own file (`YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`)

Team repo docs (`README*.md`, `*.md` at root) are owned by the team —
don't update them without a clear ask.

## Before Moving to the Next Task

Checklist before starting anything new:

1. Current branch is either merged or actively in review
2. Type check / lint passes in the worktree
3. Tests for the change exist and pass
4. Workspace-root `progress-tracker.md` reflects the completed work
5. The worktree is either cleaned up (`git worktree remove`) or
   parked deliberately

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **AI executing git push / pull / commit / merge without asking me
  first.** Even when it "looks obvious." See "AI Permission Boundaries"
  at the top of this file.
- Editing the team's rule files (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.)
  casually — even if AI suggests it, push back unless the change is a
  deliberate PR
- Creating `*_SUMMARY.md`, `FIX.md`, or any explanatory markdown
  inside the team repo (when team rules forbid it)
- Using `--no-verify` on commits — investigate hook failures, don't
  bypass them
- Switching branches in the main checkout while a PR is in review —
  use a worktree instead
- Copying secrets/credentials into `AgentJoJoy/` — they belong only
  in the team repo's `.env` or a proper secrets manager
